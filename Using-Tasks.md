My primary motivation for developing this MCP server was to address a significant gap in existing editors and extensions: the absence of an integrated task management system. This often caused the AI to lose focus and direction.

With this server, adding tasks is easy. You just write your prompt detailing what you want to build, and then instruct the AI to create and complete a sequential list of tasks. To ensure optimal workflow, it's best to specify a maximum of 6-8 tasks. Without this constraint, the AI could generate an extensive list of 10, 15, or even 20 tasks, which can be less efficient. For smaller projects, 6-8 tasks strikes the perfect balance.
